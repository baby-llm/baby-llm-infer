# Sglang Source Code Study Plan

Updated: 20250607

## Core Objectives

* **Understand Core Design:** Grasp Sglang's key architecture, including its high-performance inference and scheduling mechanisms.
* **Enhance Technical Skills:** Improve practical skills in advanced Python (e.g., async programming) and LLM inference optimization.
* **Produce & Share:** Solidify learning and share knowledge by writing high-quality code analysis articles.

### Methodology & Deliverables

1. **Code Annotation:** Annotate the source code with comments while reading to process and record understanding.
2. **Knowledge Structuring:** Systematize scattered notes and insights into structured summaries.
3. **Content Creation:** Based on a deep understanding of key modules, write technical articles or build simple, runnable examples to verify learning.

### Execution Plan

* **Weekdays:** Maintain a consistent study pace, focusing primarily on reading and understanding the code.
* **Weekends:** Dedicate focused blocks of time for knowledge output, such as organizing notes, writing articles, or hands-on coding.
