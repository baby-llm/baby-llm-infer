## Distributed Computing Concepts: Operations, MapReduce, Spark, and RDDs

This document summarizes key distributed data operations, the MapReduce paradigm, Apache Spark's execution model, how Hive SQL runs on Spark, and the fundamentals of Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).

### 1. Fundamental Distributed Collective Operations

Collective operations involve a group of workers (processes/nodes) coordinating to exchange or combine data.

* **AllReduce**:
  * **Purpose**: Combine data from all workers and distribute a single, combined result back to *all* workers.
  * **Process**: Each worker `i` has data `D_i`. A reduction operation (e.g., sum, max) is applied to all `D_i` to produce `R_combined`. `R_combined` is then sent to every worker.
  * **Output**: All workers receive the identical `R_combined`.
  * **Use Case**: Summing gradients in distributed deep learning.

* **AllGather**:
  * **Purpose**: Collect data from all workers and distribute the *entire collection* of original data from all workers to all other workers.
  * **Process**: Each worker `i` has data `D_i`. All `D_i` are collected, and the complete list `[D_0, ..., D_N-1]` is sent to every worker.
  * **Output**: All workers receive the identical complete set `[D_0, ..., D_N-1]`.
  * **Use Case**: Collecting model activations from different GPUs in model parallelism.

* **Broadcast**:
  * **Purpose**: Send the same piece of data from one root worker to all other workers.
  * **Output**: All workers receive a copy of the root's data.

* **Scatter**:
  * **Purpose**: Distribute different chunks of an array from a root worker to all other workers (worker `i` gets chunk `i`).
  * **Output**: Each worker `i` receives its specific data chunk `D_i`.

* **Gather**:
  * **Purpose**: Collect data from all workers and bring it to a single root worker.
  * **Output**: The root worker receives `[D_0, ..., D_N-1]`.

* **Reduce (Non-All variant)**:
  * **Purpose**: Combine data from all workers, but the single combined result is sent *only* to a root worker.
  * **Output**: The root worker receives `R_combined`.

* **Barrier Synchronization**:
  * **Purpose**: A synchronization point where all workers wait until every worker in the group has reached it before any can proceed.

### 2. MapReduce Programming Model

A framework for processing large datasets in parallel across a cluster.

* **Phases**:
    1. **Map Phase**: User-defined `map` function processes input key-value pairs (from data chunks) and produces intermediate key-value pairs. E.g., `(doc_id, text) -> [(word, 1), (word, 1), ...]`.
    2. **Shuffle and Sort Phase (Framework-managed)**:
        * **Shuffle**: Intermediate key-value pairs are repartitioned by key and transferred from mappers to reducers. `hash(key) % numReducers` typically determines the target reducer.
        * **Sort**: Data at each reducer node is sorted by key.
        * **Necessity**: This phase is crucial because the `Reduce` function requires all values associated with the *same key* to be processed together by a *single* reducer. Shuffle brings these values to the same location, and Sort groups them contiguously.
    3. **Reduce Phase**: User-defined `reduce` function processes each key and its associated list of intermediate values to produce final output. E.g., `(word, [1, 1, 1]) -> (word, 3)`.

* **Key Ideas**: Scalability, fault-tolerance, abstraction over distributed complexities.

**Core Differences Explained:**

* **RDD & DAG Model (Spark)**: Spark represents data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Operations on RDDs are **transformations** (lazy, build a lineage graph, e.g., `map`, `filter`) or **actions** (trigger computation, e.g., `count`, `collect`). Actions cause Spark to build a DAG of RDD dependencies. This DAG is optimized and broken into **stages** (sets of tasks performed in a pipeline, often separated by shuffles). MapReduce has a fixed two-stage (or multi-job) model.
* **In-Memory Processing (Spark)**: Spark heavily leverages memory for storing intermediate RDDs. This dramatically speeds up iterative algorithms (where data is reused) and interactive queries, unlike MapReduce's reliance on HDFS for all intermediate data.

### 4. Hive SQL on Spark: Execution Flow

When Hive uses Spark as its execution engine ("Hive on Spark"):

1. **SQL Parsing & Semantic Analysis (Hive)**:
    * Hive Driver receives HiveQL query.
    * Parser creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    * Semantic Analyzer validates AST (checks metadata against Hive Metastore) and generates an initial **Logical Plan**.

2. **Logical Plan Optimization (Spark Catalyst)**:
    * The initial Logical Plan is passed to Spark.
    * Spark's **Catalyst Optimizer** applies rule-based (RBO) and cost-based (CBO) optimizations:
        * Predicate Pushdown
        * Column Pruning
        * Join Reordering, etc.
    * Result: Optimized Logical Plan.

3. **Physical Plan Generation (Spark Catalyst)**:
    * Catalyst converts the Optimized Logical Plan into one or more **Physical Plans**, selecting specific execution strategies (e.g., `BroadcastHashJoin` vs. `SortMergeJoin`).
    * The most cost-effective Physical Plan is chosen.

4. **Code Generation (Spark Tungsten)**:
    * For CPU-bound operations within stages, Spark's **Tungsten** execution engine performs whole-stage code generation, compiling parts of the Physical Plan directly into optimized JVM bytecode. This reduces virtual function call overhead and improves CPU efficiency.

5. **RDD/DataFrame DAG Execution (Spark Core)**:
    * The Physical Plan is translated into a **DAG of RDD/DataFrame operations**.
    * **DAGScheduler**: Splits the DAG into **Stages** (based on shuffle boundaries).
    * **TaskScheduler**: Launches **Tasks** for each partition of RDDs within a stage. Tasks are sent to **Executors** (JVMs on worker nodes) for execution.
    * Data is read from Hive tables (HDFS, S3, etc.).
    * Shuffle operations are performed efficiently if required between stages.
    * Results are written back to storage or returned to the client.

### 5. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) - Spark's Core Abstraction

RDDs are immutable, partitioned collections of records that can be operated on in parallel.

* **Core Properties**:
    1. **A list of partitions**: Atomic pieces of the dataset, enabling parallelism. Each partition is processed by one task.
    2. **A function for computing each partition**: Defines how data in a partition is derived from its parent RDD(s) or source.
    3. **A list of dependencies on other RDDs (Lineage)**: Records how an RDD was derived from others. This is key for fault tolerance (recomputing lost partitions).
        * **Narrow Dependency**: Each parent RDD partition is used by at most one child RDD partition (e.g., `map`, `filter`). Allows pipelined execution on one node.
        * **Wide Dependency (Shuffle Dependency)**: A child RDD partition depends on multiple parent partitions (e.g., `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`). Requires data shuffle across nodes and marks a stage boundary.
    4. **(Optional) A Partitioner for key-value RDDs**: Defines how key-value pairs are distributed across partitions (e.g., `HashPartitioner`, `RangePartitioner`). Crucial for optimizing shuffles and joins.
    5. **(Optional) Preferred locations for computing each split (Data Locality)**: Hints to the scheduler about where tasks should run to be close to their input data (`PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL`, `RACK_LOCAL`).

* **Key Characteristics of RDDs**:
  * **Immutability**: RDDs cannot be changed once created; transformations create new RDDs.
  * **Distributed**: Data is spread across the cluster.
  * **Resilient (Fault-Tolerant)**: Lost partitions can be recomputed using lineage.
  * **Lazy Evaluation**: Transformations are only computed when an action is called.
  * **Parallel Operations**: Operations are applied to partitions in parallel.

* **RDD Operations**:
  * **Transformations**: Create a new RDD from an existing one (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `join`). Lazy.
  * **Actions**: Trigger computation and return a result to the driver or write to storage (e.g., `count`, `collect`, `saveAsTextFile`).

* **Relation to DataFrame/Dataset**: DataFrame and Dataset are higher-level, structured APIs built on top of RDDs. They offer richer optimizations via Catalyst and Tungsten and are generally preferred for structured data processing. `DataFrame` is an alias for `Dataset[Row]`. RDDs provide a lower-level, more flexible API.
